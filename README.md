# Description
Android Tiers Reforged is a total rework of Atlas' and ARandomKiwi's works with the eventual goal to make mechanical colonists and animals as closely linked to RimWorld's core systems as possible while respecting many original mechanics of the mod. Improved performance, dynamic compatibility, and code formatting are key priorities, and the code has undergone a near complete rewrite across the board to these ends.

Android Tiers itself is a mod that intends to add mechanical colonists, animals, and related mechanics to RimWorld to create a completely new playstyle and bring a very different experience to the table.

## Features
* Introduction of a generic mechanical colonist and animal system.
* Four tiers of craftable androids to interact, fight, and recruit across 2 new factions and 1 player scenario.
* Mechanical utility and military drones with animalistic intelligence fulfilling specific target roles for colonies.
* A special type of massive mechanized warforms to turn the tide of battles and the colony's future deliverable via orbital targeter.
* A system for emotionless but fully controllable drones.
* Ability to adjust what races are and are not considered mechanical, even for other mod-added races.
* Mechanical equivalents of vanilla prosthetics and medicine.
* A new "mechanic" work type that fulfills the role of doctors for mechanical units, using crafting instead of medical skills.
* Special mechanical-only surgeries and operations for resurrecting, converting, and repairing pawns.
* The ability to use surrogate pawns to extend the reach and power of individual pawns.
* The ability to use a SkyMind network to upload, download, permute, or replicate pawn consciousnesses.
* A fully functioning Skill, Security, and Hacking server system and various related tools, incidents, and abilities.
* A full research tree to delve into a more mechanized future.
* New security options such as launching or laying traps of swarms of microscythers for unwary raiders.
* A vast swath of new mechanical specific hediffs, body parts, diseases, and implants.
* A special maintenance need for mechanical pawns to fulfill in order to preserve full functionality.

## Future Expansion Concepts (Unscheduled and very low priority)
* Precepts, memes, deities, rituals, and related content for Ideology owners.
* A mechanical Empire waging war against organic life with its own joinable hierarchy, mechanics, and features.
* The mechanical revolution.
* The reintroduction (besides M7) of the M-Series combat drones, complete with variants 1 through 9 with unique features.
* Enigmatic quests, requests, and demands of the Archotechs and their "descendants" - with matching rewards.
* Compatibility with all of the things.

## Fair Warning
* I like balance.
* The day that genes are supported for ATR will arrive 2+ months after someone makes a gene framework system that is distinct and functional for all races and fully supports extensibility and modification. Don't hold your breath.
* I can't help you with bugs unless you give me a hugslog and context for an error.
